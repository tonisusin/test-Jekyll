This is a paragraph in my first post.
Show off your markdown!

## Headin two

Any text with no empty lines will become a paragraph.
Leave an blank line between headings and paragraphs.
Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.
Code can be highlighted with `backticks`. 

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number plus `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
5. three
